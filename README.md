# The Adventures of TEXTO

The Adventures of TEXTO is a text adventure game for the TI-83+ that I wrote in high school.

The TEXTO.83p binary can be loaded and played on a physical calculator or with an emulator like
[this one](https://www.cemetech.net/projects/jstified/) if you have a TI-83+ ROM file.

For the brave, also included is a text file of the source code (beware spoilers).
